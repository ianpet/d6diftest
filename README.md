Testing Dice Rolls

This is a test of probability/statistics.  Three different methods of processing a value are tested: Standard 3d6, 4d6 ignoring the lowest value, and 5d6 ignoring the lowest two values.  Also a comparison is made between standard versus throwing out the highest and lowest of each throw.
